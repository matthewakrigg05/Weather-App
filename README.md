This is a simple weather app designed to show the current temperature in celsius as well as the current descriptioin of the weather. The app allows you to search by city names in order to get the weather you are looking for. My reasoning for completing this project is to
familiarise myself with using simple HTML/CSS/JS as well as introducing myself to using APIs that are free online to build apps. In the future I intend to use other free online APIs in order to build apps that have other purposes and further grow my ability to use
the three languages mentioned.

*I do not own any images used in this project and use some items from the bootstrap framework*
